# Introduction

::: tip Motivation
I created the component library for [Destyler](https://destyler.org/), and I want to write documentation for this component and its ecosystem. However, I also want the documentation writing to focus more on the content itself, so I want to create a theme that belongs to the Destyler community. I really like the documentation style of [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), so I created this theme based on the style of this theme.
